Has anyone else played this utter garbage? You would think such a high-profile
game would have been _good_, but I guess we can't even trust Atari themselves
these days. What a ripoff.

I liked the game myself, but only after I actually went through the manual.
I got the game for my 8-year-old son who played the game for 5 minutes, got
mad, then moved on to another present. He doesn't seem keen on learning it,
either.
I don't really think Atari knows what they're doing these days. Look at
what's going on with Activision, and you can see them quickly losing it.

I read the instructions before I dived in myself, so I had no issues.
Unfortunately, I can't envision any 8-year-old waiting to play his Christmas
present patiently reading a manual, so you can kind of see where Atari went
wrong here.
