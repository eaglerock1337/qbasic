# Long distance charge ending

You connected to the remote server, but forgot your promise to your mother.
You get in trouble once your parents see the phone charge, and you get your
privileges taken away. Your computer, while you've gotten used to it and are
eager to do more, won't be able to use its modem for some time.

# Minor cyber crime ending

A few days after your antics online, you get a visit from the NYPD inquiring
about illegal cyberactivity. Your computer is confiscated and you spend the
night in jail as your equipment is searched for illegal software and activity.
While you were let off and were able to go home the next day, the computer was
promptly taken away by your parents, and you'll never touch a computer again
while living under their roof.

# Medium cyber crime ending

Two days after your antics online, you get a visit from the NYPD inquiring
about your illegal cyberactivity. You are promptly arrested and your computer
confiscated. Illegal software and activity found on your computer has made for
a strong district attorney case. If you don't go to jail, you can expect some
community service time, as well as a permanent grounded status at home.

# Major cyber crime ending

The next morning, your apartment is stormed by NYPD and SWAT who come and take
you and your computer by force. You are arrested and detained while the Altair
is examined for illegal software and activity. You are introduced to a public
defender who explains that the case against you is strong and that you will be
tried as an adult, so a plea bargain is your best chance. The DA offers you a
5-year sentence as a bargain, which you quickly take to avoid even longer
prison time. You spend the rest of your adolescence in prison.
