# qbasic

An assortment of Microsoft QBasic programs.

## about

Most of these programs came from a floppy disk I had from high school in the 90s. It is comprised of QBasic 1.1 and the two games it came with (abandonware at this point), some BASIC programs I saved from books and magazines, as well as my own attempts of modifying and creating my own programs. This also includes some programs I've created recently.

The copy of QBasic I had also included two games: QBasic Gorillas and QBasic Nibbles.

### Basic Computer Games

A book published years ago that I borrowed and made a copy of from the local library. You can view details about this book, read it, and download the listings here:
